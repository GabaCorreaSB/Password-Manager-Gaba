# Password-Manager-Gaba
First project in python that utilize different type of tecnologies and languages, with integration between them. This is the my first complicated project.
# ======================================================
This is a simple Password Manager. With this program we're able to create a password for a site that we wish to create an account with the use of Hash-256, we're able to put the Username, e-mail, url, name of the app or site together with the password that was generated for the app or site and then storing said informations on a DATABASE.

In this project I chose the postgresql tool to manage my DATABASE.
