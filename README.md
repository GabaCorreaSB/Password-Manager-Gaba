# PROJECT WILL BE CHANGING !!

# Password-Manager-Gaba
First project in python that utilize different type of tecnologies and languages, with integration between them. This is the my first complicated project.
# ==========================================================================
This is a simple Password Manager. With this program we're able to create a password for a site that we wish to register for an account with the use of Hash-256, we're able to put the Username, e-mail, url, name of the app or site together with the password that was generated for the app or site and then storing said information on a DATABASE.
# ==========================================================================
In this project I chose the postgresql tool to manage my DATABASE. For the program to work we need to install some dependencies, since I use some of python libraries on the codes.
And we need to have a DATABASE configured, so that we can change the code to work for the desired DATABASE.
